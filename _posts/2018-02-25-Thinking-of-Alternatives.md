## Consideration

So I got this running on Github Pages, I got this going and I'm able to publish (despite using a [nice headless CMS thinngy][1]). So far there's not anything missing... until I remembered [Micro.Blog][2]. There are a few options for running a server that will be a micropub endpoint that will push a file to this site... but frankly I'm not sure how well I'd be able to maintain that. 

I'll have to consider what I'm going to do in regards to Micro.blog. I'd like to use the client and [Sunlit][sunlit] when it's ready to go. Considerations.

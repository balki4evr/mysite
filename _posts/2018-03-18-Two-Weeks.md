It's been a couple of weeks since I've worked on learning any of this stuff. Which I'm fine with, I've had real work and real life getting in the way. Today I'm at swim lessons with the boys and got the local Git synced up witht he [GitHub][1] repository. Which was weird. I still don't understand how to actually work with Git, but I've got the most absolutely basic and curosry working knowledge such that I can update the site. 

I'm not sure if I'm going to focus on learning git a little better to make sure that I can keep [Working Copy][2], the local copy and GitHub all synced up, or if I want to figure out what the hell needs to happen to change my theme on here. They're both things that, I expect, will take some time. So for now, I'm just going to try to keep writing. Writing will be good for now, I have thoughts and feelings and *things* I need to process. Perhaps this isn't the best forum for those writings. But write I shall. Somewhere.

Hopefully I'll be able to keep Git working.

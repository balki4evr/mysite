So I'm going to give the whole... let's run a website thing again. Mostly becuase I feel like learning some new things and running a site built with [Jekyll][1] and deployed to [Github][2] sounds like fun. For now I'm using the most absolute basic layout (literally changed nothing from the default install), but I'll get there. Eventually. 

Until I get around to making more changes and/or whatever else... courage.

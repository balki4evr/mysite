In the last couple of days I've gotten [my Micro.blog][1] set up, finally. I tried to put in a different theme for this site, and fubared everything. And I ~~learned how to~~ fumbled through rolling back the site to a functional state. 

All in all: success. 

Next steps - learn how the hell Jekyll theming works, get the Micro.blog included on this site somehow (I'm not at a place where I'm going to run a micropub endpoint on [Heroku][2] so that I can just use this site as my Micro.blog -- but I'd love to be able eventually run everything on here as one big happy thinggy. I just don't know enough for now. Let's see if I remember how to push the update to [GitHub][3]

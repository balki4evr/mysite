My extreme rule has failed. But I'm ok with that. I've had a couple oreos this week (they're way to easy to eat and so tempting), I've had a couple of adult beverages[^alcohol] this week. I've had a number of carbier-than-originally-intedned things this week. But I feel good, so I don't care. One thing I need to work on is the abiltiy to forgve myself and move forward. So that's what I'm going to do. 

I did just get back from a 40 minute bike ride. Averaged a little over 10mph and feel pretty good, and schwety. My exercise this week has been somewhat lackluster but I'm getting into a new schedule for work, so it is what it is. The biggest failure of the week was the lack of tracking. I tracked food one day, but only one day. I'll get better at that -- I just have to get excited about it. 

Somehow I'll have to figure out how to get excited about it.

[^alcohol]: apparently, [no ammount of alcohol is safe](https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/23/health/global-alcohol-study/index.html).

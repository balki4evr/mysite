# About Elicit Behavior

It's the funniest joke I think I've ever made, and no one likes it like I do. That's ok, because the domain I got however many years ago has certainly lived up to itself. I've learned how to host a site across a variety of hosting companies, types of host and bloggin platforms. Now I'm hosting through [Netlify](http://netlify.com) and [GitHub](http://github.com). Why? Because holy shit: free custom domain hosting? Sure! Sign me up. That, of course, also means that I need to learn Git and a whole host of things around [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and maybe even a bit of Ruby. 

This will be interesting because I don't have much of the whole "coding" skills. I have enough knowledge to get myself in trouble, and make it sound like I know what I'm talking about. Hopefully I'll learn enough to actually like... code something in the future. Until then, I'll just be throwing thoughts up here.
